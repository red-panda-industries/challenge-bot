# Red Panda Challenge Discord Bot

The **Red Panda Challenge Discord Bot**, or **`rpc-bot`** for short, is the robotic minister of the **Red Panda Challenge**. The good robot communicates with our plane of existence via the portal known as **[Discord](https://discord.com/)**. The `rpc-bot` is the first robot to be minted by the emerging and powerful **[Red Panda Industries](https://github.com/red-panda-industries)**.
