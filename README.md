# Red Panda Challenge Discord Bot

## How to set up

To set up the bot I made it as simple as possible. I now created a [config.json](config.json) file where you can put the
needed things to edit.

Here is an explanation of what everything is:

| Variable                  | What it is                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| YOUR_BOT_PREFIX_HERE      | The prefix you want to use for normal commands                        |
| YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE       | The token of your bot                                                 |
| YOUR_BOT_PERMISSIONS_HERE | The permissions integer your bot needs when it gets invited           |
| YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_HERE  | The application ID of your bot                                        |
| OWNERS                    | The user ID of all the bot owners                                     |


## How to start

To start the bot you simply need to launch, either your terminal (Linux, Mac, or Windows), or your Command Prompt (Windows).

Before running the bot you will need to install all the requirements with this command:

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that you can start it with

```
python bot.py
```

> **Note** You may need to replace `python` with `py`, `python3`, `python3.11`, etc. depending on what Python versions you have installed on the machine.
